git branches

- `git branch`: lists all your current branches. 
    Then one you are on will have a `*` and be colored green
- `git branch <NAME>`: this will create a branch <NAME> where `HEAD` is
- `git switch <NAME>`: moves over to the branch <NAME>
- `git log --oneline`: see where you are
- `git push origin b1`: pushes the b1 branch to the remote
